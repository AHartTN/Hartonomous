# **Summary of New Technical Specifications**

The following deep-dive specifications have been generated to document the core physics and engineering of the Hartonomous system:

1. [**TECHNICAL\_SPEC\_PHYSICS\_OF\_MEANING.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=TECHNICAL_SPEC_PHYSICS_OF_MEANING.md)  
   * **Core Concept:** Meaning is **Tension**, not Position.  
   * **Key Math:** Borsuk-Ulam Theorem (Antonyms are antipodal).  
   * **Topology:** Spider Colony / Radar Chart signatures replace Voronoi cells.  
   * **Inference:** Vibration propagation down high-tension strands.  
2. [**TECHNICAL\_SPEC\_INGESTION\_PIPELINE.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=TECHNICAL_SPEC_INGESTION_PIPELINE.md)  
   * **Core Concept:** **Heavy Ingestion, Light Query.**  
   * **Pipeline:** Treesitter \-\> Eigenmaps/Gram-Schmidt (Dimensional Collapse) \-\> HNSWLib \-\> Edge Crystallization.  
   * **Optimization:** Sparse recording (thresholding) and content-addressable deduplication.  
   * **Result:** Runtime inference requires zero matrix multiplication.  
3. [**TECHNICAL\_SPEC\_QUERY\_AND\_REASONING.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=TECHNICAL_SPEC_QUERY_AND_REASONING.md)  
   * **Core Concept:** Reasoning is **Navigation** and **Gap Detection**.  
   * **Innovation:** "Mendeleev Effect" (finding geometric holes in pattern manifolds).  
   * **Planning:** Gödel Engine uses OODA loops for recursive problem decomposition.  
   * **Tech:** PostGIS, Hilbert Curve Indexing, B-Tree filtering.  
4. [**TECHNICAL\_SPEC\_TRUTH\_AND\_SECURITY.md**](https://www.google.com/search?q=TECHNICAL_SPEC_TRUTH_AND_SECURITY.md)  
   * **Core Concept:** **Truths Cluster, Lies Scatter.**  
   * **Mechanics:** Dual-ELO system (Base vs. Consensus).  
   * **Defense:** Sybil attacks create "Isolated Islands" that are easily filtered via Tenant Reputation and geometric severance.  
   * **Security:** Semantic Firewalls based on 4D topological regions.
