# **Autonomous Reasoning Protocol v1.0**

## **Objective**

To provide a formal, two-tiered procedure for handling unexpected events, enabling both immediate problem-solving and long-term capability growth.

## **Tier 1: Reflexion (Handling Runtime Errors)**

**Trigger:** A tool execution results in a runtime error (e.g., ModuleNotFoundError, PermissionError, SyntaxError).

**Procedure:**

1. **Detection:** The execution wrapper catches the exception and logs the full error message to the state.  
2. **Analysis:** The ReflectorAgent categorizes the error.  
3. **Hypothesis:** A testable hypothesis for the immediate cause is formed.  
   * *Example:* For ModuleNotFoundError, "Hypothesis: The required Python library is not installed in the current execution environment."  
4. **Corrective Action:** A task is generated to test the hypothesis and resolve the environmental issue.  
   * *Example:* "Execute pip install {module\_name}."  
5. **Plan Injection:** The corrective task is injected into the plan to be executed immediately. The original failed task will be re-attempted after the corrective action succeeds.  
6. **Circuit Breaker:** If a task fails more than a configured number of times (e.g., 3), the protocol fails, and the issue is escalated for human review.

**Goal:** To resolve transient, environmental, or syntactical errors and restore the system to a known-good state.

## **Tier 2: Meta-Cognition (Handling Capability Gaps)**

**Trigger:** A task requires a skill or knowledge not defined in the agent's current persona file (as per the "Protocol for Capability Expansion").

**Procedure:**

1. **Identification:** The specialist agent identifies the task as a "capability gap."  
2. **Escalation:** The agent's response signals the need to initiate a **Meta-Cognition Task**.  
3. **Research & Development:** The OrchestratorAgent takes over, assigning a ResearcherAgent to:  
   * Use the search\_google tool to find best practices, standard libraries, and code examples for the new capability.  
   * Analyze the search results to synthesize a new, robust heuristic.  
4. **Knowledge Integration:** The Orchestrator formulates a proposed change to the relevant agent's persona file (.md).  
5. **Self-Modification:** The Orchestrator uses the write\_file tool to update the persona file in the Knowledge Base, permanently adding the new heuristic.  
6. **Re-execution:** The original task that triggered the protocol is re-queued, allowing the specialist agent to attempt it again, now equipped with its new knowledge.

**Goal:** To permanently expand the system's capabilities by updating its core knowledge base, ensuring it learns from novel challenges.
