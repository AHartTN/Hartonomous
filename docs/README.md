## Platform Overview

The Hartonomous Platform is a **multi-tenant SaaS Agent Factory** that enables users to create, deploy, and monetize specialized AI agents for any domain:

### **1. NinaDB: The AI-Native Data Foundation**
SQL Server 2025 enhanced with vector capabilities, native JSON support, and memory-mapped file access. Provides secure, multi-tenant data isolation while maintaining ACID guarantees for expensive model operations.

### **2. Model Query Engine (MQE): "ESRI for AI Models"**
Revolutionary system for ingesting, indexing, and querying large parameter models (Llama4, Maverick, etc.) using T-SQL. Enables users to discover and extract specific capabilities from models to create specialized agents.

### **3. Hartonomous Agent Factory: Multi-Domain Agent Producer**
Platform for creating specialized AI agents by querying and distilling capabilities from large models. Examples include:
- **Software Development Agents** (coding, architecture, testing)
- **Chess Playing Agents** (strategy, analysis, instruction)
- **Dungeon Master Agents** (storytelling, rule enforcement, world building)
- **Domain Expert Agents** (legal, medical, financial analysis)
- **Custom Business Agents** (customer service, sales, support)

## Key Innovation: The "Horde" Architecture

The platform implements a multi-agent cognitive architecture called the "Hartonomous Collective" or "Horde":

- **Orchestrator**: Central task decomposition and delegation
- **Specialists**: Domain experts (Coder, Adjudicator, Lawman) with distinct personas
- **The Consultant**: Large multimodal model accessible via MQE
- **Constitutional AI**: Non-negotiable ethical and operational constraints

## Revolutionary Capabilities

### **Autogenous Evolution**
Agents continuously improve through:
- Self-construction of cognitive architecture
- Tool discovery and manifest maintenance
- SWE-bench integration for skill development
- File-centric prompting for structured interaction

### **Zero-Copy Performance**
- Memory-mapped model access without loading entire models
- Apache Arrow Flight for high-throughput data transfer
- In-database embeddings with transactional consistency
- Sub-millisecond SQL CLR interop

### **Enterprise-Grade Safety**
- Genesis Constitution with immutable ethical constraints
- Human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk actions
- Sandboxed execution with comprehensive auditing
- Capability self-modeling and awareness

## Business Model: Multi-Tenant Agent Factory SaaS

**"Shopify for AI Agents"** - Platform-as-a-Service for agent creation and deployment:
