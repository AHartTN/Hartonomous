## Platform Overview

The Hartonomous Platform is a **multi-tenant SaaS Agent Factory** that enables users to create, deploy, and monetize specialized AI agents for any domain:

### **1. NinaDB: SQL Server 2025 as AI-Native NoSQL Replacement**
**Core Innovation**: Unified data platform replacing MongoDB/NoSQL with native JSON + vector + FILESTREAM + graph capabilities. Provides horizontal scalability, multi-tenant security, and ACID guarantees for all AI operations in a single database system.

### **2. Model Query Engine (MQE): T-SQL REST + CLR Architecture**
**Production Implementation**: Direct llama.cpp integration using SQL Server 2025's `sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint` for model ingestion, combined with SQL CLR memory-mapped file access for sub-millisecond model weight queries. Enables T-SQL queries like `SELECT * FROM ModelComponents WHERE VECTOR_DISTANCE(embedding, @query) > 0.8`.

### **3. AI Agent Factory: T-SQL-Based Agent Distillation**
**Revolutionary Approach**: Query model capabilities using SQL, combine components to create specialized agents, apply constitutional AI safety constraints, and deploy as thin clients anywhere. After ingestion and activation mapping to Neo4j, original large models can be deleted - keeping only queryable components.

## Key Innovation: The "Horde" Architecture

The platform implements a multi-agent cognitive architecture called the "Hartonomous Collective" or "Horde":

- **Orchestrator**: Central task decomposition and delegation
- **Specialists**: Domain experts (Coder, Adjudicator, Lawman) with distinct personas
- **The Consultant**: Large multimodal model accessible via MQE
- **Constitutional AI**: Non-negotiable ethical and operational constraints

## Revolutionary Capabilities

### **Autogenous Evolution**
Agents continuously improve through:
- Self-construction of cognitive architecture
- Tool discovery and manifest maintenance
- SWE-bench integration for skill development
- File-centric prompting for structured interaction

### **Zero-Copy Performance**
- Memory-mapped model access without loading entire models
- Apache Arrow Flight for high-throughput data transfer
- In-database embeddings with transactional consistency
- Sub-millisecond SQL CLR interop

### **Enterprise-Grade Safety**
- Genesis Constitution with immutable ethical constraints
- Human-in-the-loop approval for high-risk actions
- Sandboxed execution with comprehensive auditing
- Capability self-modeling and awareness

## Business Model: Multi-Tenant Agent Factory SaaS
