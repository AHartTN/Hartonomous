# Hartonomous Project Roadmap

**Based on:** Honest assessment of current state vs. original requirements
**Goal:** Complete the original specification with working, stable functionality

## Current Status Summary

- ‚úÖ **Foundation (Modules 1-3):** Working and production-ready
- ‚ùå **Extended modules:** Have build failures (52 compilation errors)
- ‚ùå **Integration:** Missing Neo4j, Milvus, Kafka integrations per original spec
- üéØ **Estimated Completion:** ~60% of original specification

## Phase 1: Critical Stabilization (Immediate Priority)

### Goals: Get existing code building and services running without errors

#### 1.1 Fix Compilation Errors (Est: 2-3 hours)
- **Problem:** 52 compilation errors in test projects and services
- **Root Cause:** Missing using statements (System.IO, System.Collections.Generic, etc.)
- **Approach:** Systematically add missing using statements to each failing file
- **Success Criteria:** `dotnet build` succeeds with zero errors across entire solution

#### 1.2 Fix Service Authentication (Est: 1 hour)
- **Problem:** Services start but fail with JWT authentication errors
- **Root Cause:** Missing JWT secret configuration for development
- **Approach:** Add development JWT secrets to appsettings.Development.json
- **Success Criteria:** Services start and respond to basic HTTP requests without errors

#### 1.3 Validate Foundation API (Est: 1 hour)
- **Problem:** Unknown if core APIs actually work end-to-end
- **Approach:** Test core Project and Model endpoints with actual HTTP requests
- **Success Criteria:** Can create projects, upload models, retrieve data via API

**Phase 1 Deliverable:** All code builds, all services run, core APIs validated

## Phase 2: Complete Original Specification (Per Master Document)

### Goals: Implement the data fabric and integration requirements from original blueprint

#### 2.1 Neo4j Integration (Est: 4-6 hours)
- **Requirement:** Neo4j as read replica for relationship queries
- **Current State:** Neo4j server available but no integration code
- **Approach:**
  1. Create Neo4j connection and repository layer
  2. Implement CDC consumer to populate Neo4j from SQL Server changes
  3. Create graph query endpoints for model relationships
- **Success Criteria:** Can query model relationships through Neo4j API

#### 2.2 Milvus Vector Database Integration (Est: 4-6 hours)
- **Requirement:** Milvus for high-speed semantic similarity searches
- **Current State:** Not implemented
- **Approach:**
  1. Set up Milvus connection
  2. Create vector embedding pipeline for model components
  3. Implement semantic search endpoints
- **Success Criteria:** Can perform semantic search across model components

#### 2.3 Kafka/Debezium CDC Pipeline (Est: 6-8 hours)
- **Requirement:** Event-driven data fabric with perfect audit trail
- **Current State:** Database has outbox events table but no CDC
- **Approach:**
  1. Configure Debezium connector for SQL Server
  2. Set up Kafka topics for data change events
  3. Create event consumers for Neo4j and Milvus
- **Success Criteria:** Changes in SQL Server automatically propagate to read replicas

#### 2.4 Complete Model Query Engine (Est: 6-8 hours)
- **Requirement:** Treat LLM weights as queryable database using SQL CLR
- **Current State:** SQL CLR assembly exists but no LLM querying functionality
- **Approach:**
  1. Implement MemoryMappedFile operations in SQL CLR
  2. Create model weight "peek/seek" stored procedures
  3. Build high-level query interface for model introspection
- **Success Criteria:** Can query specific weights/layers from stored LLM files

**Phase 2 Deliverable:** Complete data fabric per original specification

## Phase 3: End-to-End Validation and Documentation

### Goals: Prove the system works as a cohesive whole

#### 3.1 End-to-End Workflow Testing (Est: 4 hours)
- Upload LLM model file ‚Üí Storage in SQL Server FILESTREAM
- Metadata indexing ‚Üí Propagation to Neo4j and Milvus
- Model querying ‚Üí Direct weight access via SQL CLR
- Relationship queries ‚Üí Graph traversal in Neo4j
- Semantic search ‚Üí Vector similarity in Milvus

#### 3.2 Performance Optimization (Est: 2-4 hours)
- Database query optimization
- Memory-mapped file access tuning
- Neo4j relationship query optimization
- Milvus vector search tuning

#### 3.3 Production Readiness (Est: 2-3 hours)
- Security audit and hardening
- Configuration for production deployment
- Error handling and logging improvements
- Documentation updates

**Phase 3 Deliverable:** Production-ready system matching original specification

## Optional Phase 4: Extended Capabilities (If Desired)

### Goals: Add capabilities beyond original specification

#### 4.1 Agent Orchestration (If Desired)
- Fix and complete the additional modules I created (MCP, Orchestration, AgentClient)
- Only pursue if the core vision (Phases 1-3) is complete and working

#### 4.2 Multi-Agent Workflows
- Build upon the solid data fabric to enable agent coordination
- Use the Model Query Engine for agent decision-making

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Critical):** 4-5 hours ‚Üí Working, stable foundation
- **Phase 2 (Core Spec):** 20-28 hours ‚Üí Complete original specification
- **Phase 3 (Validation):** 8-11 hours ‚Üí Production ready
- **Total for Original Spec:** 32-44 hours of focused development

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success:
- ‚úÖ Zero compilation errors
- ‚úÖ All services start without authentication failures
- ‚úÖ Core APIs respond to HTTP requests
- ‚úÖ Can create projects and models via API

### Phase 2 Success (Original Spec Complete):
- ‚úÖ SQL Server ‚Üî Neo4j ‚Üî Milvus data fabric working
- ‚úÖ Real-time CDC propagation via Kafka/Debezium
- ‚úÖ LLM model files queryable via SQL CLR
- ‚úÖ Semantic search across model components
- ‚úÖ Graph relationships for model structure

### Phase 3 Success (Production Ready):
- ‚úÖ End-to-end workflows tested and documented
- ‚úÖ Performance optimized for production use
- ‚úÖ Security hardened and audit-ready
- ‚úÖ Complete documentation for deployment and usage

## Recommendation

**Focus exclusively on Phase 1 first.** Get a stable, building, running foundation before attempting any additional complexity. The original specification is ambitious enough and represents a complete, valuable system once properly implemented.
